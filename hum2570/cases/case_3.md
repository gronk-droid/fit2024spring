1. **If Katherine Gordon could give birth to a clone of her deceased daughter, should she? Explain your answers.**

According to a deontological viewpoint, it would be wrong to intentionally harm the upbringing and quality of life that a child has. Therefore, it would be morally wrong to clone her daughter, as it would likely lead to some emotionally scarring situations where people might recognize her as Emily, and that could also cause her to feel the need to replace her.

2. **Is grief over the loss of a child a morally legitimate reason for wanting to clone him or her? Explain your answers.**

No, as your grief does not trump a level of human rights that are deserved by a child. Their death might have been untimely and unfortunate, but choosing to try and force a clone of them to fill their shoes emotionally is a level of morally wrongdoing that many fail to attain.

3. **Is there a morally relevant difference between sexually producing a child to replace a lost one and producing a child through cloning for the same reason? Explain your answers.**

This seems to depend on whether the parents of the prospective child are choosing to clone the child to directly replace what their child was to them. If the cloning is there to directly replace the child's attributes, it might be more morally questionable than if a couple simply would like to try and have another child. Replacing a deceased child does not necessarily imply that they want to abuse the child emotionally and try to mold them into their previous offspring. Cloning for that reason seems to have the connotation that the parents want the child to fulfill a certain role that they already have chosen for it. This directly harms the child's ability to have their own personality and choices in life.
