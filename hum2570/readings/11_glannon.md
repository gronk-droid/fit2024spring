("Genetic Enhancement," Glannon)

"The main moral concern about genetic enhancement of physical and mental traits is that it would give some people an unfair advantage over others with respect to competitive goods like beauty, sociability, and intelligence. . . . Enhancement would be unfair because only those who could aford the technology would have access to it, and many people are fnancially worse of than others through no fault of their own. Insofar as the possession of these goods gives some people an advantage over others in careers, income, and social status, the competitive nature of these goods suggests that there would be no limit to the benefts that improvements to physical and mental capacities would yield to those fortunate enough to avail themselves of the technology ('Genetic Enhancement,' Glannon)."

1. Genetic enhancement would give unfair advantages to some.
2. Theses advantages would only be available to those that can afford them.
3. Limiting treatments based on social class diminishes some people.
4. Therefore, genetic enhancement is immoral.

This argument is valid and sound, as it follows a premise-conclusion format. The idea that limiting treatments that could increase quality of life for people based on one's ability to afford it is a problem, and I can see why this line of thinking is a possible way for one to conclude about genetic enhancement being wrong compared to genetic therapy.
