"A Response to a Purported Ethical Difficulty with RCTs Involving Cancer Patients," Freedman

"However, <u>in some cases we are uncertain about whether an intervention will serve the best interests of the other, and so we ask that person</u>. That is one reason for requiring informed consent to studies. There is another. <u>By obtaining the consent of the other party to treat him as an end to oneâ€™s own means, in effect, an identity of ends between both Kantian dictum</u>, **then**, we should ask: *Is there anything about clinical trials that necessarily implies that subjects are treated contrary to their personhood? And the answer is, of course, no-provided a proper consent has been obtained*." ("A Response to a Purported Ethical Difficulty with RCTs Involving Cancer Patients," Freedman)

1. It is unsure some cases of intervention actually will help serve the best interests of another, so we ask the patient if they want to partake.
2. Asking for consent treats them as their own end.
3. Therefore, asking for consent makes certain that an RCT is in the best interest of a patient.

This argument is deductive and strong, as its premises are true.
