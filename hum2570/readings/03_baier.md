"The Need for More than Justice," Baier

It is clear, I think, that the best moral theory has to be a cooperative product of women and men, has to harmonize justice and care. The morality it theorizes about is afer all for all persons, for men and for women, and will need their combined insights. As Gilligan said, what *we need now is a “marriage” of the old male and the newly articulated female insights*. If she is right about the <u>special moral aptitudes of women</u>, **it will most likely be** the *women who propose the marriage*, since they are <u>the ones with more natural empathy</u>, with the <u>better diplomatic skills</u>, the <u>ones more likely to shoulder responsibility and take moral initiative</u>, and the <u>ones who find it easiest to empathize and care about how the other party feels.</u> ("The Need for More than Justice," Baier)

1. We need a marriage of virtue ethics and justice morally.
2. Women have a stronger moral aptitude towards making this marriage happen.
3. Thus, it will most likely be women who will cause the marriage.

Here, Baier's argument is valid, but only sound if it is conceivable that only women are able to apply these moral aptitudes that she describes. I believe it is possible for both women and men of today to work alongside each other and bring this idea of "old male" justice and progressive women's thought together into a neatly wrapped bow.
