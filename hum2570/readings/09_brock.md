"Cloning Human Beings: An Assessment of the Ethical Issues Pro and Con," Brock

"While <u>psychological harms of these kinds from human cloning are certainly possible, and perhaps even likely in some cases</u>, they remain at this point only speculative since we have no experience with human cloning and the creation of earlier and later twins. Nevertheless, <u>if experience with human cloning confrmed that serious and unavoidable psychological harms typically occurred to the later twin</u>, that would be a serious moral reason to avoid the practice. Intuitively at least, <u>psychological burdens and harms seem more likely and more serious for a person who is only one of many identical later twins cloned from one original source</u>, so that the clone might run into another identical twin around every street corner. This prospect could be a good reason to place sharp limits on the number of twins that could be cloned from any one source."

1. Cloning will inevitably affect cloned humans psychologically with what they should be like due to other clones of their genome existing.
2. This will bring about psychological harm to cloned humans that are copied after another human.
3. Therefore, it is morally unacceptable to clone human beings.

The argument is sound as its premises are true. If choosing to clone a human being means that it will inevitably harm them, then it must be morally wrong to clone humans.
