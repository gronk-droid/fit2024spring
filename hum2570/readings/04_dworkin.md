Dworkin, Paternalism

"Now it might be thought that <u>there are no cases of “impure” paternalism since any such case could always be justifed on non-paternalistic grounds, i.e. in terms of preventing harm to others.</u> Thus we might <u>ban cigarette manufacturers from continuing to manufacture their product on the grounds that we are preventing them from causing illness to others in the same way that we prevent other manufacturers from releasing pollutants into the atmosphere, thereby causing danger to the members of the community</u>. The difference is, however, that in the former but not the latter case the harm is of such a nature that <u>it could be avoided by those individuals affected if they so chose</u>. The incurring of the harm **requires**, so to speak, the *active cooperation of the victim*. *It would be mistaken* theoretically and hypocritical in practice *to assert that our interference in such cases is just like our interference in standard cases of protecting others from harm*." (Dworkin, "Paternalism").

1. Impure paternalism cannot be justified on non-paternalistic grounds such as preventing harm to others.
2. Banning cigarette manufacturers could be good because of this preventing of harm.
3. There is no reason one could not choose to avoid the harm.
4. Therefore, it is wrong to assert interference in impure paternalistic cases.

Here, Dworkin is arguing that there are cases where paternalistic choices cannot be made on simple grounds like choosing to prevent harm to others, since the liberties it takes do not equate to the good that the interference creates. This argument is valid, and the premises seem to be sound, as Dworkin is looking to create a world where paternalism is only helping, and not hurting the liberties people have.
