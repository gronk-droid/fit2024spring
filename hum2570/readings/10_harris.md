("Is Gene Therapy a Form of Eugenics?" Harris)

"Against a background in which many people are standardly protected from birth or before against pollution hazards and infections and have their healthy life expectancy extended, it would surely be plausible to claim that failure to protect in this way constituted an injury and left them disabled. Because of their vulnerability to infection and to environmental pollutants, there would be places it was unsafe for them to go and people with whom they could not freely consort. Tese restrictions on liberty are surely at least prima facie disabling as is the increased relative vulnerability." ("Is Gene Therapy a Form of Eugenics?" Harris)

1. Humanity has decided it is morally right to protect themselves from vulnerability, such as environmental factors or disease.
2. Being disabled can be considered as a vulnerability to the normal factors of everyday life.
3. Therefore, if being disabled is a disadvantage, it is a vulnerability and we must protect others from it, thus making gene therapy morally correct.

This argument is sound and valid, as its premises are true, therefore the conclusion is. As far as the strength of the argument, it would be interesting to test a simple disability that many people overcome all of the time, such as auto immune diseases that render them more susceptible to illnesses many others don't even notice.
