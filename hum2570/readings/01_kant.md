"The Moral Law," Kant

"From what has been said, it is clear that *all moral conceptions have their seat and origin completely a priori in the reason*, and that, moreover, in the commonest reason just as truly as in that which is in the highest degree speculative; that they **cannot** be obtained by abstraction from any empirical, and therefore  merely  contingent  knowledge;  <u>that  it  is  just  this  purity  of  their  origin  that  makes  them  worthy to serve as our supreme practical principle, and that just in proportion as we add anything empirical,  we  detract  from  their  genuine influence,  and from the absolute value of actions</u>..." (Kant, "The Moral Law")

1. The purity of intention directly influences an actions moral implications.
2. The moral conceptions are a priori in the reason.
3. Therefore, only the intention of a moral action impacts its moral weight.
