"The Presumptive Primacy of Procreative Liberty," Robertson

"*Procreative liberty should enjoy presumptive primacy when conflicts about its exercise arise because control over whether one reproduces or not is central to personal identity, to dignity, and to the meaning of one’s life*. For example, <u>deprivation of the ability to avoid reproduction determines one’s self definition in the most basic sense</u>. <u>It affects women’s bodies in a direct and substantial way. It also centrally affects one’s psychological and social identity and one’s social and moral responsibilities</u>. <u>The resulting burdens are especially onerous for women, but they affect men in significant ways as well</u>. " ("The Presumptive Primacy of Procreative Liberty," Robertson)

1. Reproduction affects men and women physically, socially, morally, and psychologically.
2. Depriving the ability of someone to avoid reproducing affects their self identity.
3. Therefore, procreative liberty should be protected because reproduction choices are central to people's self identities.

This argument is sound, arguing that reproduction and the choice for it is central to people's sense of self, and cannot be taken away without significantly harming said self identity.
