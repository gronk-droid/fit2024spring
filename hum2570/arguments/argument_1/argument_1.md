1. According to rule-utilitarianism, good actions result from following a moral rule that will produce the greatest good outcome.
2. A moral rule "Maximize the enjoyment of a persons life over the length of it" should maximize the overall good for a person.
3. Keeping a terminally ill child who is in pain alive preserves the length of their life but harms their enjoyment of life, and physician-assisted suicide would increase their overall enjoyment of life, following that moral rule.
4. Therefore, terminally ill children should be able to choose physician-assisted suicide.
