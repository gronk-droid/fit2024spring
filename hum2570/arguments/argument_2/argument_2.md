**Is the practice of outsourcing clinical trials to CROs in developing countries morally permissible?**

1. According to virtue ethics, one must follow traits that lead to a morally good outcome.
2. Choosing to perform clinical trials on developing countries knowing full well that many of the participants are unable to understand what they are choosing to take part in just to save money is quite greedy.
3. Therefore, it is not morally permissible to outsource clinical trials to developing countries.
