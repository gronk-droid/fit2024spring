**But even if we can clone humans, should we? Or should human cloning (both reproductive and therapeutic/research cloning) be banned?**

1. In Kantian ethics, human beings have inherent dignity and moral worth that must be protected.
2. Cloning human beings creates people with identical genetic makeup to an existing person.
3. Copying ones genetic makeup removes the uniqueness of individuals, reducing them to copies, and does not respect their intrinsic value.
4. Therefore, cloning human beings is morally impermissible because it violates a human being's inherent dignity and moral worth.
